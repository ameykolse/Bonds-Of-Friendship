My comrade true from days of yore,
Through life's tempests, we both did soar.
In jovial mirth and heartfelt cheer,
A steadfast bond that time holds dear.

********************************Best Friend*******************************

With you, I laugh, I cry, I share,
In your embrace, I find solace rare.
Through thick and thin, you're by my side,
My confidant, my endless guide.

Through every trial, our spirits stay true,
A cherished connection, forever anew.
Hand in hand, we journey together,
In this eternal bond, our souls tether.
