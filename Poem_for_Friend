My comrade true from days of yore,
Through life's tempests, we both did soar.
In jovial mirth and heartfelt cheer,
A steadfast bond that time holds dear.

My confidant, my endless guide.

A treasure trove of memories we hold,
In your friendship, worth more than gold.
Through every chapter, hand in hand,
My best friend, you truly understand.


Through every trial, our spirits stay true,
A cherished connection, forever anew.

In this eternal bond, our souls tether.
