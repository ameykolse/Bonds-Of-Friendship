My comrade true from days of yore,
Through life's tempests, we both did soar.
In jovial mirth and heartfelt cheer,
A steadfast bond that time holds dear.

Through every trial, our spirits stay true,
A cherished connection, forever anew.
Hand in hand, we journey together,
In this eternal bond, our souls tether.
